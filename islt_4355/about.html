        <h3>A Little Bit About Me</h3>
        
        <p>
            Hello, I am Isaac Schroeder. I am a senior in <strong>computer science</strong> at the University of Missouri. <br>
            I have always enjoyed anything involving problem solving, so I was drawn to programming as a career. 
            I have lived in Columbia Missouri my whole life, but I look forward to the possibility of traveling and 
            learning about other places through a future career. In my free time, I enjoy gaming, both in video form 
            and tabletop form. I find gaming as a great way to spend time with my friends, especially those who live 
            far away. Additionally, I like to be outside whenever the weather is nice. You will often find me out on a 
            local disc golf course. Disc golfing has recently become my favorite outdoor activity. I like playing casual 
            disc golf rounds with my friends, and I have begun competing in tournaments as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently pursuing a bachelors in computer science at the University of Missouri, Columbia. 
            Additionally, completing a minor in mathematics. On track to complete education by May 2023.
