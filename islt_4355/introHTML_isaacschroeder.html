     Hello everybody, I am Isaac Schroeder. I am a senior computer science student at the University of Missouri. 
     I want to develop software for a living after graduating. Most of my coding experience exists in the game development 
     and embedded systems development areas, and I possess very limited web development experience as well. 
     I am looking to solidify my skills in the basics of web page design with this course, as well as gain some 
     skill and understanding in how to go about creating effective user interfaces. I hope to supplement my 
     existing programming knowledge with the web development abilities acquired from this course, to be best 
     prepared for whatever programming career path I end up following. One activity I enjoy in my free time is 
     gaming (video and tabletop) with my friends. Additionally, I like to hike local trails and disc golfing at 
     local courses when the weather permits.
