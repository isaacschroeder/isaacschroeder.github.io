            If you are looking for a qualified software developer, your search may end here. 
            My name is Isaac Schroeder, and I possess a variety of programming capabilities 
            which might be of interest to you or your company. This website outlines my educational 
            accomplishments, software projects, and previous positions of employment. I have 
            experience over several development areas, ranging from embedded system hardware 
            projects to application creation on multiple platforms. My innate interest in problem 
            solving through coding helps me to continuously expand my knowledge through taking on 
            new technologies and projects. I look forward to employment with a company who is 
            interested in making the world a better place. I am not particular about what kind 
            of programming I will be doing as long as I can contribute in a meaningful way. Be 
            sure to reach out through my contact page if you are in need of my skill set.
