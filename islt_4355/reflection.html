                <h3>Career So Far</h3>
                <p class="firstParagraph">
                    While my career so far has been limited to undergraduate research and internships, I feel that 
                    I have been able to accumulate some quality professional software development experience. I am 
                    very proud of myself for what I have accomplished, but I am also very thankful to the coworkers 
                    I have had along the way. In addition to being available as teachers when I got stuck, the people 
                    who I have been fortunate enough to work with have enabled me to get the most out of the time 
                    and energy I put into the work I have done. Where I used to value the desirability of the task of
                    a job far above all else when determining an optimal place of employment, I have come to value 
                    the quality of the people who I will be working alongside just as much.

                <h3>Future Career Goals</h3>
                <p class="followingParagraph">
                    Generally speaking, I don't have any desire to perform a particular kind of software engineering 
                    over another. I will be content doing any kind of programming, whether it be hardware development, 
                    mobile development, or whatever else, so long as there is an interesting problem solving aspect to 
                    the position. However, I find that contributing to something of significance that can make a 
                    positive impact on people's lives is much more enticing than chasing bugs around in a meaningless 
                    program for a company who doesn't have a growing mindset. I am going to put my best effort into 
                    whatever position I am in, and I expect a similar attitude from any company I sign on with.

                <h3>Coursework Experiences</h3>
                <p class="followingParagraph">
                    I have been fortunate to gain a wide range of code experience from my coursework at the University 
                    of Missouri, and the implementation skills I have learned have gotten me far. While skills in 
                    specific tools and languages are great, I believe that the most important knowledge I have gained 
                    from my time in the computer science department has been in design theory. Anyone is capable of 
                    picking up a programming language and building a program given a blueprint, but how does one produce 
                    a blueprint themselves? I have been able to employ the various design techniques I have learned in 
                    my computer science courses to great success in the projects I have worked on in my research and at 
                    my internships. This is where the value of obtaining a formal education shines the brightest in the 
                    computer science field, and I am thankful that I have had the opportunity to attend a University.

                <h3>Range of Experience</h3>
                <p class="followingParagraph">
                    I have been able to accumulate a range of experience in software development. At one end of the 
                    spectrum, I have spent a lot of time in professional settings close to the hardware, coding for 
                    embedded systems. I gained an appreciation for the other disciplines of engineering when working 
                    on these hardware projects, as I had to acquire a certain level of understanding of the devices 
                    which I was coding for. On the other end of the spectrum, I have produced applications for multiple 
                    platforms, including both mobile and desktop. Prototyping apps has helped me to consider the user 
                    more actively when programming, as an application which is not designed for the user is no good at 
                    all. Overall, I think the perspectives I have gained from the experience I've obtained has allowed 
                    me to develop into a well rounded programmer.
