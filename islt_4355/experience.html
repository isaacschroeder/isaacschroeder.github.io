                Performed embedded software development duties for the Caterpillar Medium Track-Type 
                Tractor team from May to August of 2022. Primarily implemented coded solutions in C to complete 
                assigned tasks. Provided general software maintenance for the machines codebase, as well as designing, 
                implementing, and testing a complete rework of the cab lighting feature for medium tractors. Worked on 
                a team composed of engineers of multiple disciplines and put communication skills to work to ensure 
                work was done optimally and correctly. Problem solving skills were paramount to identifying existing 
                issues and determining the best strategies for problem resolution. Conducted extensive testing via both 
                hardware-in-the-loop and simulated methodologies.

                <p>
                Caterpillar has been my favorite place to work so far. During my time there I was able to accomplish great 
                things. I learned a lot about working on a large codebase, the elaborate mechanics and electronics that go 
                into construction vehicles, and challenges that come with developing heavy machinery. Additionally, I learned 
                about how to work effectively in a team, and I was fortunate to have some really amazing coworkers. I am 
                very happy with the work that I was able to contribute to the codebase. I've been told that my changes will 
                reach production vehicles within the coming months.

                <p>
                Worked on developing new and innovative products for the medical field from June to December of 2020. 
                Not only operated as an embedded software developer, but additionally took on typical duties of an 
                electrical engineer, determining the electronic components to be used within multiple devices, reading 
                integrated circuit data sheets, and testing prototype circuit boards. Worked closely with electrical 
                engineers and mechanical engineers to prototype devices and rapidly improve them. Primarily utilized 
                Microchip 8 bit PIC microcontrollers, programming them in C and limited assembly. Created intuitive 
                state-machine based software capable of handling numerous sensor inputs and updating output indicators 
                with low latency. Utilized several serial communication protocols to operate complex connected 
                integrated circuits.

                I had fun during my time at Plasmadent because I was essentially in a research and development role 
                - basically every engineer's dream job. I was able to have a huge amount of say in how projects were 
                designed and I had free reign to architect the software in the way I thought was best. While the 
                freedom was awesome, it was initially very overwhelming. I was able to overcome the difficulty I 
                encountered through independent research, careful and thorough planning, and learning from my superiors.

                Produced multiple playable games for research applications from Fall semester 2021 to Spring semester 
                2023. Worked primarily independently, operating as a one man development team. Initially, worked on 
                prototype games for the University of Missouri's CAVE virtual reality environment to show off its 
                potential functionality to interested parties and to become familiar with the system. Eventually, 
                partnered with meteorology Professor Eric Aldricch to produce a game in the CAVE environment for teaching 
                students about the weather event known as a mid latitude cyclone. Additionally, worked on a set of 
                three games designed to measure relative cognitive function to be used to test how music impacts game 
                playing ability. Said games were referred to as "brain games".

                Working on Professor Wang's research team has been a ton of fun. It has allowed me to enhance my skills 
                in my favorite type of software development, game development, while simultaneously contributing to 
                interesting research projects. I am proud of what I have been able to produce in the past 3 semesters, 
                and I am hoping that one day I can use the skills I have acquired in the video game industry.
